# Viola-Jones

Python implementation of the face detection algorithm describe in _Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple
Features_ by Paul Viola and Michael J. Jones.

Steps:

1. Selecting Haar-like features
2. Creating an integral image
3. Running AdaBoost training
4. Creating classifier cascades

# Example
